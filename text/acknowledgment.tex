\chapter*{Acknowledgment}

The authors would like to thank MMag. Dr. Michael Stifter who had enough faith in us to set us up with this project and provide the necessary financial means to complete it. Additionally we would like to acknowledge the expertise of Daniel Maximilian Swoboda, often referred to as Swobo, who provided invaluable insight into the writing process of a diploma thesis. Lastly, we would like to thank our favorite barista Manfred, whose surname we have not been able to determine yet. \\
